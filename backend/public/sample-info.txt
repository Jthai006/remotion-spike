Place your sample video file here as sample-source.mp4

You can use any MP4 video file for testing. Some options:
1. Download a free sample video from https://sample-videos.com/
2. Use any local MP4 file you have
3. Use a public video URL

The frontend is configured to look for:
http://localhost:4000/public/sample-source.mp4

Simply rename your test video to "sample-source.mp4" and place it in this directory.
